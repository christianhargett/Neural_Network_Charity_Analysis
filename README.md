# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

In this project we are attempting to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if they receive funding from our client, Alphabet Soup. Our goal is to build a neural network that will take a dataset containing the applicants (provided by Alphabet Soup) which will make predictions based off of certain data points. 

## Results

### Data Processing
- Our target variable is the "IS_SUCESSFUL" column in our dataset. This column contains a value of either "0" or "1"; a score of "0" means that the company used the funding effectively while a "1" score means the company DID use their funds effectively.
- The datapoints that our neural network uses to determine if an applicant will be successful or not are called "features" Our feature variables are as follows: "APPLICATION_TYPE", "CLASSIFICATION", "AFFILIATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "INCOME_AMT".
